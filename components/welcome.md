# Sous-Chef Voice Ordering Study

Thank you for agreeing to participate in the Sous-Chef study.
Our goal is to gain a better understanding of user interactions
with speech ordering kiosks at restaurants.

During the study, you will be asked to place a number of food orders at a simulated restaurant ordering kiosk. You will place orders by speaking into your microphone. We expect the entire session will take less than 5 minutes.
